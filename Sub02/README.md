# micro-task 02
## 1. Introduction
* Based on the [decription](https://www.britannica.com/science/human-body), construct a **Class Diagram** that depicts the human body as organization.
* If you cannot find all the answers you need in the description, you can make your own assumptions (see **chapter 4** below).

## 2. Goals
During this task, you have to accomplish (and check, accordingly) the following **goals**:
- [ ] Depict human body as a class with at least 2 **attributes** and 2 **methods**.
- [ ] Depict the basic systems of the human body as **classes** (not less than 3, not more than 10).
- [ ] Depict at least one class as **Abstract** (whichever you want).
- [ ] Depict the **relationships** between the basic elements (Aggregations and/or Compositions, Associations, Dependencies, Inheritance etc.) that better fit your diagram.
- [ ] Depict at least one **enumeration**.
- [ ] Depict at least one class attribute as **static** (whichever you want).

## 3. Guidelines
* You have to use only [starUML](https://staruml.io) to build the diagram.
* Upload in this folder of your repository the final **pdf** file, extracted from starUML. The filename format should be CD_sdi0xxxxxx.pdf (where **sdi0xxxxxx** is your student id number).
* Upload in this folder  of your repository a printscreen from starUML and tag it in current README.md file.
