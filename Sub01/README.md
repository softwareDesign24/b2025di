# micro-task 01
## 1. Introduction
* Based on the [decription](https://www.britannica.com/science/human-body), construct a **Use Case Diagram** that depicts the human body as organization. The actors that interact with the organization will be animals (mammals, birds, fish).
* If you cannot find all the answers you need in the description, you can make your own assumptions (see **chapter 4** below).

## 2. Goals
During this task, you have to accomplish (and check, accordingly) the following **goals**:
- [ ] Depict system boundary.
- [ ] Depict the basic use cases (not less than 3, not more than 10).
- [ ] Depict actors.
- [ ] Depict the relationships: associations, includes, extends, generalizations.

## 3. Guidelines
* You have to use only [starUML](https://staruml.io) to build the diagram.
* Upload in this folder of your repository the final **pdf** file, extracted from starUML. The filename format should be UCD_sdi0xxxxxx.pdf (where **sdi0xxxxxx** is your student id number).
* Upload in this folder  of your repository a printscreen from starUML final task and tag it in current README.md file (see example below).
